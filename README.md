## About
Config file for Phoenix window manager for Mac OS ([GitHub](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix/))

## Grid
Screens are split into a grid that is 12 wide and 6 high. This allows for half, third and quarter window widths, and half and third window heights.

Windows are snapped to the grid when they open.

Also ^⌥Z = Toggle left (75/50/25%), ^⌥X = Toggle right (75/50/25%)

### Sixths
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|E|R|T|

Also ^⌥C = Left two thirds, ^⌥V = Centre with border, ^⌥B = Right two thirds

### Eighths
