## About
Config file for Phoenix window manager for Mac OS ([GitHub](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix/))

Based on the config file by jasonm23 ([GitHub](https://github.com/jasonm23/Phoenix-config))

## Concepts
Screens are split into a grid that is 12 wide and 6 high. This allows for half, third and quarter window widths, and half and third window heights.

Shortcuts are provided to move windows to halves, quarters, sixths and eighths of the screen, as well as other convenience functions.
